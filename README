Implementation of the Apriori Algorithm
=======================================

The Aprioroi algorithm is an older data mining technique for learning
association rules.  This work provides a C and python implementation of
the algorithm.  More information on the algorithm can be found in:

Status
------

As of October 2009, the C implementation is more thoroughly tested and
optimized.  The core is built as a library linked into programs that
want to use the apriori algorithm.  I simple wrapper called use_apriori
is provided to demonstrate using apriori.

----
cd $PYAPRIORI/c/src
make
make use_apriori
./use_apriori -w14 -s0.001 $PYAPRIORI/evaluation/recoded_3000.txt
----

Testing is of the C implementation uses the
http://code.google.com/p/cmockery/[cmockery framework].  Building the
apriori library for testing and running the tests is accomplished using:

----
cd $PYAPRIORI/c/src
make DEFS="-DUNIT_TESTING"
cd $PYAPRIORI/c/test
make
