The main apriori test uses as input the following stream of IDs to
create transactions of length four:

1 1 2 3 5 8 1 3

This results in the following five transactions:

1 1 2 3
1 2 3 5
2 3 5 8
3 5 8 1
5 8 1 3

The first transaction is reduced to a four element set due to the
repeated digit "1".

The last two transactions are equivalent, since the order of elements in
a transaction does not matter.

This set of transactions generates the following subset counts:

1 -> 4
2 -> 3
3 -> 5
5 -> 4
8 -> 3
1 2 -> 2
1 3 -> 4
1 5 -> 3
1 8 -> 2
2 3 -> 3
2 5 -> 2
2 8 -> 1
3 5 -> 4
3 8 -> 3
5 8 -> 3
1 2 3 -> 2
1 2 5 -> 1
1 3 5 -> 3
1 3 8 -> 2
1 5 8 -> 2 
2 3 5 -> 2
2 3 8 -> 1
2 5 8 -> 1
3 5 8 -> 3
1 2 3 5 -> 1
2 3 5 8 -> 1
1 3 5 8 -> 2
